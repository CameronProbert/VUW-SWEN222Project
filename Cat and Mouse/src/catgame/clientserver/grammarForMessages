
Each message sent from master-slave and slave to master will either be 0, signalling a non-update or will consist of 16 numbers.

For the first 4 digits:

0100 : move north
0101 : move west
0102 : move east
0103 : move south

0104 : attack ~ next 4 numbers are player ID then next 8 number character attacked ID 
0105 : object added to inventory ~ next 4 numbers are player ID then next 8 numbers are object ID 
0106 : object removed from inventory ~ next 4 numbers are player ID then next 8 numbers are object ID (removing will just delete object?)
0107 : moved to room ~ next 4 numbers are player ID then next 8 numbers are room ID
0110 : consume item ~ next 4 numbers are player ID then next 8 numbers are object ID

any numbers less than 16 will have 0 place holders to make 16 numbers

Numbers 1-10 are reserved for player ids. Numbers 11-99 are reserved for other object ids. 
Although it is not necessary to do this I think it makes it less confusing
