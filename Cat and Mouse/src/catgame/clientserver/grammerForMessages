
Each message sent from master-slave and slave to master will either be 0, signalling a non-update or will consist of 16 numbers.

For the first 4 digits:

0001 : move left
0002 : turn right
0003 : turn up
0004 : turn down

0005 : attack ~ next 8 numbers are player ID then character attacked ID 
0006 : object added to inventory ~ next 8 numbers are player ID then object ID (this could make remove object 
					unnecessary as it should make the original holder no longer holding the object removed)
0007 : object removed from inventory ~ next 8 numbers are player ID then object ID (removing will just delete object?)
0008 : moved to room ~ next 8 numbers are player ID then room ID
0009 : consume item ~ next 8 numbers are player ID and object ID

any numbers less than 16 will have 0 place holders to make 16 numbers
